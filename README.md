## Challenges

This was a full-stack extra challenge that I made by myself in two weeks during my studies at Lighthouse Labs, so most challenges that arise in development I faced. It's a single page app written almost entirely with jQuery and ajax alone, so probably the largest challenge was keeping track of the game state and keeping code DRY and well-organized. If I were to redo it, I'd definitely switch to a user-friendly framework like React. Knowing that I wanted to implement not just a single player version, but a multiplayer version as well, this project challenged me to keep my code modular and ready for reuse down the line.
